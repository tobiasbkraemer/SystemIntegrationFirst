# Wait! We forgot something…

What about other types of media than bytes and raw text?

Images, audio and videos.

*What types are there? How are the types that can be sent over the internet?*

---

# Mime Types

MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) was originally defined for SMTP in [RFC 2045](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045) but used for:

- Email (SMTP): `Content-Type` in message bodies.

- HTTP: `Content-Type`, `Accept` headers.

- File uploads: `multipart/form-data`.

- Multimedia containers and streaming (e.g., `video/mp4`, `audio/webm`).

- Browsers: Determine how to handle files (render or download).

- OS-level file associations (via file extensions + MIME sniffing).

|---------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Examples**  | `video/mp4`, `audio/webm`, `application/json` | H.264, VP9, Opus, AAC         |
| **Purpose**   | Tells software how to handle the data     | Compresses/decompresses media  |
| **Defined by**| IANA (via RFCs)                           | Standards bodies (ITU, ISO) |

# Ways to send files FROM clients TO servers

1. **Fetch**: Sending raw binary with an ArrayBuffer. 

2. **Fetch + FormData**: Sending files with FormData.

3. **HTML Forms**: Sending files with `multipart/form-data`.

---

# Sending files FROM clients TO servers with Fetch

1. **Fetch**: Sending raw binary with an ArrayBuffer. 

    ```javascript
    const file = document.getElementById('fileInput').files[0];
    fetch('/upload', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': file.type
        },
        body: file // or file.arrayBuffer()
    });
    ```

2. **Fetch + FormData**: Sending files with FormData.

    ```javascript
    const file = document.getElementById('fileInput').files[0];
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('file', file);

    fetch('/upload', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
    });
    ```

# Let's code with `multipart/form-data`

We will create HTML forms `multipart/form-data` (multipart MIME) to send files FROM the client TO the server.

In Node.js with Multer and Python with FastAPI (built-in).

1. First, let's send form data. 

2. Second, let's send files.

# Base64 Encoding

## What is it?

64 characters which are the alphanumeric characters (lowercase and uppercase), +, / and =.
Try in the browser with atob() and btoa()

## Why is it needed?

Escaping special characters. 

When you need to represent an image as text. 

Because SMTP traditionally only supported 7 -bit ASCII characters. 

Transfer images over SSH (SCP).

## Who uses it?

Inspect the network tab: `chrome://dino` 

---

# Base64 Encoding Images

A String representing a Base64 encoding of an image can be used in HTML and CSS. 

## Example 1 - Innline in HTML

```html
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4
  //8/w38GIAXDIBKE0DHxgljNBAAO9TXL0Y4OHwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" alt="Red dot" />
```

## Example 2 - Inline in CSS

```css
.gif {
    background-image: url(data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCAAHAIABAGSV7f///yH+EUNyZWF0ZWQgd2l0aCBHSU1QACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAAIAAcAAAINjI8BkMq41onRUHljAQA7);
```

# Base64 Encoding - The efficiency argument

* (-) The encoding adds an overhead of ~ 33% - 37%.  

[Source - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)

* (+) Removes separate HTTP requests for image loading by embedding images in the CSS or the HTML… 

* (-) … but larger file sizes means that the client will have to do more round trips to get the entire content anyway. 


**Sub-Conclusion**: Could use it for really small files where the size outweighs the HTTP request overhead. 

---

# Base64 Encoding - Pros and Cons

**Conclusion**: You should probably not do it but it’s relevant since you might have to integrate with systems that provide images as Base64. 

* (-) SEO prefers public URLs. 

* (-) Not compatible with browsers image caching. 

* (+) Can be easily saved in databases. *Should you?*

---

# Blobs in DBs - **DON'T DO IT!**

* (-) Not scalable. 

* (-) Slow. Storage is faster than memory. 

* (-) Expensive. Computations are many times more expensive than storage.  

* (-) Unable to preview or look at meta information if it’s stored in a database. 

* (+) Back up the DB and the files in one scoop. 

*How should you store media?*

---

# File servers

Store files on a file server. A file server is a computer that stores files and makes them available to other computers over a network. It is computationally and financially cheaper and much faster than having to go through a database.

All cloud providers have services for storing files. They might name them differently but they are basically file servers. 

Examples for AWS and Azure:

**AWS**: S3

**Azure**: Azure Blob Storage 

Both cloud providers offer additional services for other storage needs.

# Audio in HTML

We can use the `<audio>` tag to play audio files in HTML: 

```html
    <audio src="./assets/<song_name>.mp3" controls>
        </audio>
```

# Streaming Protocols

* WebRTC
* (!) Only client to client

* RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol)

* RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol)
* (-) RTMP and RTSP are HTTP incompatible. 

* MPEG-DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)

* HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)
* (+) Both MPEG-DASH and HLS support adaptive bitrate streaming.

# Remember the good old days?

When YouTube would load the whole video as you were watching it and if you had no internet you could still watch videos since they were already loaded?

But you had to manually choose the quality of the video and if the video was too slow you could try at a lower quality?

---

# Enter MPEG-DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)

Adaptive Streaming works by creating multiple versions of the same video at different bitrates and resolutions.

The client can automatically switch between these versions based on the current network conditions.

MPEG-DASH is used by [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_YouTube_features) and [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/html5-and-video-streaming-a3563b19eb02).


---

# HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) vs. MPEG-DASH

You might encounter references to HLS.

Even though HLS is a proprietary protocol developed by Apple it has been submitted to the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) as a draft standard and is widely used.

---

# Let's try it out

1. [Install ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

2. Download the following famous sample video often used to test codecs:

https://sample-videos.com/

Rename it to input.mp4.

3. Use ffmpeg to create a DASH stream + a manifest file.

```bash:
$ ffmpeg -i input.mp4 \
-map 0:v -map 0:a -b:v:0 200k -s:v:0 426x240 -profile:v:0 baseline -b:a:0 48k \
-map 0:v -map 0:a -b:v:1 400k -s:v:1 640x360 -profile:v:1 baseline -b:a:1 64k \
-map 0:v -map 0:a -b:v:2 800k -s:v:2 854x480 -profile:v:2 main     -b:a:2 96k \
-map 0:v -map 0:a -b:v:3 1200k -s:v:3 960x540 -profile:v:3 main    -b:a:3 96k \
-map 0:v -map 0:a -b:v:4 1800k -s:v:4 1280x720 -profile:v:4 high   -b:a:4 128k \
-map 0:v -map 0:a -b:v:5 2500k -s:v:5 1920x1080 -profile:v:5 high  -b:a:5 160k \
-f dash playlist.mpd
```

Similar commands can be found in the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/DASH_Adaptive_Streaming_for_HTML_5_Video) that might be faulty, however.


---

# The manifest file `playlist.mpd`

```xml
type="static"
```

**Type**: Means VOD instead of live. 

**Duration**: mediaPresentationDuration="PT2M50.8S"

**Segment granularity**: maxSegmentDuration="PT5.0S"

Aditionally, the different quality streams are defined in the manifest file with each segment `<S />` having a duration attribute. 

## For the files:

* the `init-stream<id>.m4s` files contain the meta data (codec info, container headers) but no media frames. 

* the `chunk-stream<id>-<number>.m4s` files contain the media segments.

---

# Setup the backend and frontend

1. Setup Express to serve an HTML page, serve the content as static. 

2. In the frontend, get [Shaka Player](https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-player) from a CDN and initialize the player.

The frontend just needs the path for the manifest file. If the video chunks are served as static, it will make the requests when needed. 

**Warning**: Dash.js will work with chunking the stream but will not work with adaptive bitrate streaming. Use Shaka Player, which is created by Google.


---

# Network Throttling

Go to the Network tab in the DevTools and a throttle option. 

**REMEMBER**: Remove throttling once you are done. **IMPORTANT**

Check out how it affects the video playback and how different streams are loaded.

You could also add the following to your frontend to see logs in the console:

```javascript
player.addEventListener('adaptation', () => {
    const variant = player.getVariantTracks().find((track) => track.active);
    console.log(`[SHAKA] Adapted to ${variant.height}p (${variant.bandwidth}bps)`);
});
```

# MPEG-DASH - Pros and Cons

*What are the pros and cons of MPEG-DASH?*

---

# MPEG-DASH - Pros and Cons

* (-) Operationally complex.

* (-) Additional storage costs.

* (-) Additional encoding costs.

* (+) Better user experience. 

* (+) Faster initial load time

* (+) Highly scalable.

* (+) Saves money for large video host providers.
