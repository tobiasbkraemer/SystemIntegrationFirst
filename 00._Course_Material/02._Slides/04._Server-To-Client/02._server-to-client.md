# Server -> Client ?


1. How can a client get the latest data from a server?

2. How can a server update a client with new data unprompted?

---

<div class="title-card">
    <h1>Client polling, long polling</h1>
</div>


---

# Client Polling (Short Polling) - How it used to be done

1. Client and server establish a new connection.

2. Server parses the HTTP headers. 

3. Server queries for new data.

4. Server sends a response (in most cases empty if no change).

5. Connection is then closed.

Client requests again later since it does so in predefined intervals.

*Pros and cons*?

---

# Long Polling - Simple solution

Uses the “keep-alive” header.

Long polling has since the early days become standardized in the browser.

1. A request is sent to the server.

2. Server doesn’t close the connection until it has a message to send.

3. Server sends a response with the update.

4. The connection is closed.

5. The browser immediately makes a new request.

*Pros and cons*?

---

# Long Polling

* (-) Does not scale to many clients. Server has to keep track of all open connections.

* (-) Only works well for having to send few messages.

* (-) Scalibility complications when working with distributed systems.

* (-) Overhead for every request being made (compared to SSE).

* (-) Latency issues. Is dependant on when the client makes the next request (as opposed to SSE)

* (+) Simple to implement.

* (+) Reduces request overhead compared to short polling.

* (+) No need for special client support. Works over standard HTTP.

<div class="title-card">
    <h1>Server-sent events (SSE)</h1>
</div>

---

# Server-sent events (SSE)

Based on the same technique as long polling.

Unidirectional. Allows servers to update clients as long as the client has the appropriate code setup.

Most browsers today [support it](https://caniuse.com/eventsource). No libraries needed. Just declare:

```javascript
new EventSource("url");
```

And the server must respond with the following in its header:

```json
{
    "Content-Type": "text/event-stream"
}
```

---

# Required Headers and their meaning


| Key             | Value                | Reason why                                              |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `Connection`    | `keep-alive`         | Keeps the connection open for continuous event streaming. |
| `Content-Type`  | `text/event-stream`  | Ensures the browser treats the response as an event stream. |
| `Cache-Control` | `no-cache`           | Prevents stale data by disabling caching, ensuring real-time updates. |

---

# SSE Sending data

The format to send data is:

```plaintext
data: somedata \n\n
```

| Field   | Purpose                                                                |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `event:` | Defines a custom event type (instead of the default `"message"`).     |
| `id:`    | Assigns a unique identifier to the event (used for reconnection).     |
| `retry:` | Suggests a reconnection delay (in milliseconds) if the connection is lost. |

To send a data event, the data sent must start with `data:`.


While `\n\n` signals the end of an event, `\n` signals a newline in the event to send multiple lines of data:

```plaintext
data: Line1
data: Line2
```


---

# SSE Reconnection

Reconnection is built into the protocol. 

If the server wants the browser to stop reconnecting, it should respond with HTTP status `204 (NO CONTENT)`.

If the browser wants to close the connection, it should call eventSource.close():

**Note**: Reconnection will fail if other HTTP status code than the following are sent: `200, 204, 301, 307`.

---

# SSE Postman

It is possible to test SSE with Postman.

Just create a new HTTP request and it will pick up based on the header that you want to setup EventSource and changes the view for you. 

---

# Long polling vs. SSE - I

## Connection Management

Long Polling: Each client request is held open on the server. Connection closes after sending data. The client must initiate a new request.

SSE: Single, long-lived connection. The server can send multiple messages.

## Client Handling

Long Polling: Client list cleared after each round of data.

SSE: No need to manually manage a list of clients.

## Protocol

Long Polling: Standard HTTP requests.

SSE: Utilizes a specific protocol over HTTP that requires sending data in a special format (‘text/event-stream’). Requires the client to be able to interpret the format.

---

# SSE Pros and cons

When to ues SSE and when to use long polling:

* **Long Polling**: Generally, only use it when clients can’t use SSE.

* **SSE**: Frequent real-time updates from server to client.

Discuss in pairs: *What are the pros and cons of SSE?*

We haven't talked about WebSockets yet but I will include a comparison here. 

---

# SSE Pros and cons in comparison to long polling

* (+) Lower latency compared to other HTTP-based ways to stream data.

* (+) Less server load (CPU and network usage) by reducing the number of HTTP requests.

* (+) Doesn’t add unnecessary server load (because of long polling). 

* (+) Built-in reconnection.


---

# SSE vs. WebSockets

| EventSource      | WebSockets          |
|------------------|--------------------|
| One-directional  | Bi-directional     |
| UTF-8           | Binary and UTF-8   |
| Plain HTTP      | WebSocket Protocol |


---

# SSE pros and cons in comparison to WebSockets

* (-) Limited to text-data. Can only transmit UTF-8.

* (-) Doesn’t scale. Limited amount of maximum open connections. Browsers usually set this number to 6 for HTTP/1 which will be exhausted if more than 6 SSE tabs are open:

https://stackoverflow.com/a/16853226 

* (+) Sent over HTTP. Does not require a special protocol.

* (+) Built-in support for reconnecting.

* (+) Creates unique event-ids.

* (+) Not likely to raise in firewalls that do packet inspection + filtering.

* (+) Less overhead in maintaing a single connection than a bi-directional one.

# Example: Hybrid SSE and WebSocket chat system

- SSE for low-bandwidth, passive updates.
- WebSockets only when needed.
- Automatically switches based on user activity, keeping performance optimal while reducing server load.  


1. User opens chat -> An SSE connection is established:
 
2. User starts typing frequently (e.g. three messages within 10 seconds) -> Upgrade to WebSocket to reduce latency:
    
3. User stops typing (e.g. for 30 seconds) -> Close the WebSocket connection -> Downgrade to SSE:


We will go over WebSockets next time.
