# Webhooks

Fish hook metaphor. We hook into a service. They can pull the line and send data (a payload) to us.

Nicknamed a reverse API because the server updates "*us*".

*Does this sound familiar?*

# Why can't we just use SSE?

| Feature                     | Server-Sent Events (SSE)                                              | Webhooks                                                              |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Communication direction    | Server-to-client, specifically browser clients using EventSource.     | Server-to-server communication.                                       |
| Initiator                  | Initiated by the client.                                               | Initiated by the server.                                              |
| Receiver requirements      | Requires a client to remain connected to the server.                  | Requires a server to be running to receive the data.                  |
| Real-time behavior         | **Streaming real-time** via a continuous connection for updates.          | **Event-driven real-time** where the sender pushes when something happens.|

# Why webhooks?

*What are some use cases for webhooks?*

---

# Webhooks - Real-world use cases

* CI/CD server

* Chatbots (Discord, Slack)

* E-commerce (notify external systems of new orders, inventory changes, shipments)

* Monitoring / alerting

* Calendar events

* IoT (update external systems)

* Online Payment

# Let's imagine a world without webhooks

Let's see how online payment works with Stripe after the payment has been finalized. 

1. Settlement by bank.

2. Stripe transfers money to the merchant. 

3. [Optional] The customer disputes and gets a chargeback.

4. [Optional] The customer gets a refund from the merchant.

5. [Optional] Failed payout. Bank issues results in Stripe not paying. 

6. [Optional] Fraud review / reversal. 

*Try to assign time to each step.* 

Imagine checking constantly for thousands of customers in those timeframes.

# Security: SSE vs. Webhooks

SSE relies on same-origin policy or CORS.

Webhooks require authentication/verification (signatures, tokens).

# Webhooks - Pros and cons

*What are the pros and cons of webhooks?*

---

# Webhooks - Pros and cons

* (-) Hard to test locally / debug.

* (-) Delivery not guaranteed. If your server is down, events will be lost. Must combine with an API.

* (-) Security concerns. Requires a public endpoint.

* (+) No need for polling.

* (+) Real-time updates.

* (+) Scalable. HTTP requests can be distributed.
