# Git hooks !== Github webhooks

Git hooks have nothing to do with webhooks.

They are a way to **hook** into the git life cycle.

**Webhooks** are a way to **hook** into an application.

Confusingly, we will be using webhooks with Github later on.

# Git Hooks - Our first hook

Let's first try to create a `hello world` git hook.

First initialize a git repository. 

In the `.git/hooks` folder, create a file called `pre-commit`. You can copy the sample for inspiration (assuming you are in the hooks folder):

```bash
$ mv pre-commit.sample pre-commit
```

Add an echo statement to the file:

```bash
$ echo "Hello, world!" > pre-commit
```

Now try to commit and see the result.

# Linting with `Standard`

Create a Javscript file with some intentional errors.

You can run [Standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard#is-there-a-git-pre-commit-hook) in the project to lint the code

```bash
$ npx standard
```

Or to fix it:

```bash
$ npx standard --fix
```

# Git Hooks - Adding `Standard` to a hook (*nix and Git Bash)

In the `pre-commit` file replace the content with the following. 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard#is-there-a-git-pre-commit-hook

It requires you to have Standard installed. The above script will work if you install it globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g standard
```

Or you could modify the script to use the `npx` command:

```bash
xargs_r -E '' -t npx standard
```


You could also install it locally in the project with (`npm install standard`) and modify the script like this:

```bash
xargs_r -E '' -t ./node_modules/.bin/standard
```

# Git Hooks - Adding `Standard` to a hook (Powershell)

```powershell
# Ensure all JavaScript files staged for commit pass standard code style
function xargs-r {
    param (
        [ScriptBlock]$Command
    )

    $paths = git diff --name-only --cached --relative | Select-String -Pattern '\.jsx?$' | ForEach-Object { $_.Line }

    if ($paths) {
        $paths | ForEach-Object {
            &$Command $_
        }
    }
}

$xargsCommand = { param ($path) standard $path }

xargs-r $xargsCommand

if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
    Write-Host 'JavaScript Standard Style errors were detected. Aborting commit.'
    exit 1
}
```

# pre-commit library

Tip: There is a library called `pre-commit` that can be used to manage and easily install git hooks.

# Git hooks pros and cons

**Pros**

  - Early Error Detection / Immediate Feedback

  - Prevents bad commits from being checked in to version control

**Cons**

  - Local Only

  - Manual Configuration

  - Bypassable (with the `--no-verify` flag)

  - Cross-Platform Issues (bash scripts could cause problems on Windows)
