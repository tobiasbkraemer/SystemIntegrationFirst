# 00 Install these

**Type**: Individual

Of course, you don't need to do anything if you already have these. Check if you do by running different versions of `--v`, `-v`, `--version` etc. or just run the command. 

When you see "$" below it signifies the terminal prompt and should not be added to the command to run.

## Install Poetry

We will use Poetry to easily create virtual environments and manage dependencies for each project. It will make it easier for you to run code in my project. 

Many students have issues with installing / running Poetry so it is not a strict requirement. But if you get it to work then it will make your life easier. 

I will motivate it in week 2 as to why we use it.

1. Install Poetry: https://python-poetry.org/docs/main/

Remember to read the instructions after installing. For instance, for Windows you should run **Optiona A**. It will look *similiar* to this example command:

```powershell
$ [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User") + ";C:\Users\[PATH\TO\USER\Python\Scripts]", "User")
```

**DO NOT** run the above command. Copy it from the output after installing Poetry. The above command is an example that is missing the correct path.



2. Install the shell plugin:

```bash
$ poetry self add poetry-plugin-shell
```

3. Test it out. 

Success criteria: Be able to run:

```bash
$ poetry --version
$ poetry init -n
$ poetry shell
```

May sure that you can do this in your favorite editor / IDE. Many students install it in one terminal but can't run it in the integrated terminal in their editor.

If you install a version 3.x.x of poetry instead of 2.x.x you might need to install the plugin as an extra step:

## Install Node.js. 

Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download

Both LTS (long-time support) or Current are fine.

## Install Postman and create account

https://www.postman.com/

Create an account. We will be using features that require the non-lightweight version as they call it. You can use a throwaway email to signup.

## Make sure you can run Python

Python comes preinstalled on all operating systems but make sure that you can run Python on your computer. 

You might need to run this on Windows in an admin Powershell terminal to run Python. 

```powershell
$ Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

Install Docker: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

## Windows users only

Install Chocolatey: https://chocolatey.org/

Don't use CMD. 

Not a requirement but recommended: Install Windows subsystem for Linux: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

Make sure that you can actually run it. If you have Docker installed prior to it then it will try to launch in Docker and fail. This is the solution to that problem:

## Mac users only

Install homebrew: https://brew.sh/
