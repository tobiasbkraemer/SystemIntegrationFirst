# 08d [DLS Group] Generate code documentation for your DLS project

**Type**: DLS Group

Hand-in: Depending on what makes sense for you and the way your group creates code documentation hand in the entire documentation. Suggestions could be a link to a Git repository, a link to a hosted documentation site, a downloaded site, screenshots, PDF etc. 
 
Note: Since this is a group activity that you can draw for the exam, it's fine if one person sets it up but everyone in the group should be able to explain how it works for the exam. 

You are not required to cover your entire codebase since I understand that some of you might have microservices etc. that would make it difficult to cover everything.

You are free to use others but this if just for reference.
