# 13a [Individual] GraphQL

**Type**: Individual

Have a code example for the following [schema.graphql file](./schema.graphql).


### Criteria for completion

Recommended: Install any extension for syntax highlighting of `.graphql` files.

Implementing Subscription is optional.

The minimal requirement is that you should setup a server that can be queried through the GraphQL explorer, REST client (Postman) or a frontend. 


### Choosing a library

As always, you can choose any library in any language (code-first or schema-first). 

I have provided finished examples for Node (Apollo) and Python (Ariadne). You can bring them to the exam as long as you have a decent (not perfect) understanding of how they work.

If you implement your own version or expand on the provided templates then you are encouraged to use Copilot.

### Improvements

The code examples are not made recently so feel free to suggest improvements by making a PR.

For the Node project feel free to suggest improvements especially when it comes to the Typescript setup. 

For the Python project feel free to implement Subscriptions.
