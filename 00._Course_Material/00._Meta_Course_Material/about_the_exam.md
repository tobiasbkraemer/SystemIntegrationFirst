# The Exam

The previous stated idea of SI being a course that provides you a tool box and the ability to select the right tool gives a good idea of how you should approach the exam. Rather than deep knowledge about each topic a basic understanding of them is expected. This is good because there will be many possible topics that can be asked.

Last semester that were about 30 questions with an almost 50/50 split between questions of the type:
- **Explain** ... (theory)

Or:

* **Show the code** ... (code that had to be handed in)

The code assignments that you can draw will use the codes 01a, 02a, 02b etc. That's why it would be helpful if you name the folders exactly the same way.

### The exam questions

You will not be given the sheets with all the questions. The things you can draw during the exam match 1:1 with the semester plan. You can be asked to show any of the homework not labeled as [Optional] or "Resource" as well as any of the bullet points in the learning goals column.

If there is a topic in the topics column that doesn't show up in the learning goals column then that is not subject for the exam. The learning goals should tell you how much you are expected to know about a topic and in what way.

Why don't you get the sheet of exam questions?

1. There is no reason to maintain two lists of almost identical information. The semester plan is the single source of truth. 
2. If I promised to give you a document later on with all the exam questions then everyone will (even if subconsciously) wait until the document is given to prepare of the exam. I want everyone to know that the semester plan is what you can draw and to prepare for the exam weekly.

### Code during the exam

If you draw a question that you don't have code for then you will be asked to live code it.

You will normally not be asked to run the examples. The focus is on understanding the code, what it does, how the integration works.

You are allowed to come to the exam with my code or generated code but you still need to understand it. And it must follow the learning goals.

You can work on the code until the exam but remember to push the code before the exam.
