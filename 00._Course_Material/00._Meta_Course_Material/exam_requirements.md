# System Integration - Exam Requirements

This document contains the formal requirements for the exam. Additional information can be found [here](./about_the_exam.md).

The total exam time is 30 min.

**Language**: Danish (Unless you have applied for exemption which has been approved)

You will draw multiple questions from the following two columns in the semester plan: 

* Learning Goals.

* Resources and activities.

The questions are a mix of theory and showing code examples. 

If you only draw theoretical or code questions we will draw more questions until you have drawn at least one of each type.

You are not allowed to bring notes to the exam.

You are expected to have the code examples ready in one project, sorted by assignment codes and prepared to immediately show the relevant files when you draw a question. The only exceptions are the assignments that are marked [Optional] that lack an assignment code.

In most cases you will not be asked to run the code examples. Instead, you should be able to open the relevant files and point to the relevant part of the code. Don't just read the code out loud. Explain what it does and how it relates to the topic.

The code examples are part of the mandatories. If you don’t have them ready, you will be asked to live code the topic without online help or use of code-assisting tools (Github Copilot). To avoid this, be prepared.

## Additional Advice

You get a chance to start talking about the topic. 

If you say something that is incorrect I will stop you and correct you or I will ask leading questions to give you a chance to correct it yourself. So a good strategy would be to ensure that you are using correct terminology and saying things that are absolutely correct. 

If you are lost or stray off topic I will start asking leading questions. Even if you have already said many good things already and I will try to probe your knowledge about things that haven’t been mentioned in the conversation so far. 

Me stopping you at any time should not be taken as an ill omen but I’m rather trying to have a conversation with you. If you ace that conversation, even if there are inaccuracies, then you are doing really well.
